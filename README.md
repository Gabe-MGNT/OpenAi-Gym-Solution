# Reinforcement Learning Solutions (OpenAI Gym)

![Open Ai Gym logo](https://www.silicon.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/openai-cover.png)


## Context

This repository contains various solutions that I have found for different reinforcement learning problems using OpenAI Gym.

It's also a way for me to learn and improve in reinforcment learning, as I am trying to propose easy solutions to tasks.


## Structure

This repository is organized into different directories, each representing a specific reinforcement learning problem. Within each directory, you can find the solution code or a subdirectory implemnting a solution using a given alogrithm (example of the mountain car that can be solved using QLearning and DeepQ Learning).

*An explanation about the task and what will be done and the notebook that can be executed right away*

## Getting Started

There's not much to do, I tried to things simple as I can with any of the solutions in this repository, just download the Notebook, make sure you have all the dependencies/libraries and execute the code.
